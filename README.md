# Device-Clustering-Project

Get information about the most recent Smartphone CPU. Generally, High-end smartphones have the latest and most powerful CPU. We'll get the data from the [Nanoreview](https://nanoreview.net/en/soc-list/rating) ranking

This will be used to create a device clustering algorithm that uses this and other data to classify devices into high, medium and low tiers.
